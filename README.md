# C-PipeLining
Using multiple pipelines and forks in C to run an input sequence through a number of biquad filters
This program uses the biquad filter found in my other repository named "Biquad-Filter"
Make sure both that program file and the one in this repository are placed in the same working directory before running cascade.c
